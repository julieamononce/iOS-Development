## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- Pinterest:The organization of pictures, the explore feature, and how widgets work perfectly with the app
- Spotify: Equalizer, the DJ feature
- Instagram:Deleting messages, sharing music with your story feature, and reels

I’ve always loved coffee shops and pastries. As a college student, coffee shops have become my go-to spots for staying focused on tasks while also feeling like I’m in a scene from a movie (I know it sounds weird, but I’m sure I’m not the only one). Imagine an app that helps you find coffee shops or study spots nearby that give you that same satisfying feeling. It wouldn’t have to be limited to coffee shops—parks, libraries, and other study-friendly places could be included too. The app could rank these spots based on how “aesthetically pleasing” they are, with students from all over sharing reviews and comments.

It could even recommend places based on your previous experiences. And wouldn’t it be great if there were a section for student discounts or rewards? For example, after visiting a coffee shop a certain number of times, you could earn a discount or maybe even a free pastry. Just an idea, but it’s something.

## Notes

Honestly learning where everything is was challenging. I have so many ideas, but it was hard to figure out how to add a new screen, or scroll through the app. I would change the way I went about the project and add a new button called "my favs". Once you push the button you would be shown a new page with images of my favorite cafes, libraries, pilates and yoga places. I would basically make a simple version of my app brainstorm. But, for now I am happy to have an app that scrolls and has basic functions. I will continue to make it better.
